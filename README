Requirements
============
To build the ODD jar, you need Maven 2.x installed.

Building the beans
==================
In this directory, do the following:

mvn clean install

This will build the ODD jar in:

target/odd-beans-1.0.0.jar

The source for the beans is generated in:

src/main/java

Usage
=====
To see how to use the jar, have a look at the unit tests in:

src/test/java

If you use IntelliJ IDEA, follow the instructions in pom.xml to generate project files.

Oddbod ODD profile
==================
The file xsd/oddbod.xsd defines an emerging ODD profile called Oddbod. This is being used
as the data format for migrating Elgg 0.9 to 1.5.
